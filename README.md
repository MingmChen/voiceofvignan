Voice of Vignan is an Android application built on top of Firebase key  features like authentication,real-time database,storage as well as cloud messaging. Cloud functions are also used to trigger instant notifications. 

Voice of Vignan is intended to help the student community at my campus to get all interesting happenings in real time. This app notifies the users when some update about latest events, campus news,student clubs as well as the official announcements are posted by the admin. The most engaging feature is push notifications for every update that is posted on the app.
